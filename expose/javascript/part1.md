1. 'values added: 20' is printed to the console log at line 9.
2. 'final result: 20' is printed to the console log at line 13.
3. 'values added: 20' is printed to the console log at line 9.
4. An error is returned at line 13, as result's block scope is within the if statement, but line 13 is outside of its scope.
5. The code outputs an error, as since result is a const variable, it cannot be changed to equal num1 + num2.
6. Similar to problem 5, the code will output an error due to trying to change the value of const variable result.
